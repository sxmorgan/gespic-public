## Overview

This repository contains data necessary for obtaining the figures in our preprint. 

> Essex M, Rios Rodriguez V _et al._ Spondyloarthritis, acute anterior uveitis, and Crohn’s disease have both shared and distinct gut microbiota **medRxiv** (2022) https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275044v1

![graphical-abstract](/figures/abstract.png/)*Known genetic risk factors can partially but not fully explain the well-established epidemiology of these related diseases; microbiota composition captures complex environmental factors which may help generate more precise hypotheses related to shared and distinct pathophysiology, treatment response, and prognosis.
