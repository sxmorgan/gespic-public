## fig-1
* Shannon entropies and principal coordinates for the full dataset
* Cohort, Phenotype, and Enterotype labels

## fig-2
* Statistical calculations for microbial features and clinical covariates from [`metadeconfoundR`](https://github.com/TillBirkner/metadeconfoundR) v0.1.9
* Naïve_sig and Robust_sig both denote level of significance from Spearman or Cliff's delta correlations
* Stars in the _Naïve_sig_ column indicate that a feature-covariate pair was confounded
* Stars in the _Robust_sig_ indicate that no other covariates tested explained a given feature abundance better

## fig-3
* Raw data and metadata needed for the main figure(s) from the metabolic pilot study subset
* _Veillonella_ and _Fusicatenibacter_ given in relative abundances
* Acetic and butyric acid concentrations given in µM/L
* Tryptophan and kynurenine concentrations given in ng/mL
* CRP in mg/L

## sfig-1
NA

## sfig-2
* Genus and phylum relative abundances for the full dataset

## sfig-3
* Functional module relative abundance predictions and correponding metabolite concentrations for the metabolic pilot study subset
* M00023: bacterial tryptophan synthesis
* M00038: bacterial tryptophan metabolism
* MF0088-89: bacterial butyrate production
* MF0086: bacterial acetyl-CoA to acetate metabolism
* MF0075: bacterial acetate to acetyl-CoA metabolism

## sfig-4
* Fecal calprotectin and Harvey-Bradshaw indices for the CD cohort
* Calprotectin in mcg/g
