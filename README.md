## Overview

This repository contains data necessary for obtaining the figures in our preprint. 

> Essex M, Rios Rodriguez V et al. _Spondyloarthritis, acute anterior uveitis, and Crohn’s disease have both shared and distinct gut microbiota_ **medRxiv** (2022) [https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275044](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.05.13.22275044)

![graphical-abstract](/figures/abstract.png/)*Known genetic risk factors can partially but not fully explain the well-established epidemiology of these related diseases; microbiota composition captures complex environmental factors which may help generate more precise hypotheses related to shared and distinct pathophysiology, treatment response, and prognosis.
